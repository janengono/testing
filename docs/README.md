# Hiking Logbook – Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **Hiking Logbook** project.  
This file serves as a **table of contents** and guide to navigate both **product documentation** (what we built) and **process documentation** (how we built it).  

Our tutor and stakeholder emphasized the importance of **clear, professional, and high-quality documentation**, so this structure is designed to be intentional, consistent, and easy to follow.

## 📌 Documentation Standards

- **File Format**: Markdown (`.md`) for readability on GitHub and easy conversion to PDF if required.  
- **Naming Conventions**: Lowercase filenames with underscores if needed (e.g., `architecture_design.md`).  
- **Cross-Referencing**: Each requirement is traceable to UX artifacts, architecture components, and test cases.  
- **Versioning**: Documentation evolves with each sprint and release. Previous versions are tracked in Git history.  

---

## 📊 Metrics Approach

To measure project quality and progress, we track:
- ✅ Story points completed per sprint.  
- ✅ Number of test cases written vs. passed.  
- ✅ Bugs logged and resolved.  
- ✅ Deployment success rate.

## 📚 Glossary

- **Logbook**: A digital record of hikes including notes, weather, and GPS routes.  
- **Planned Hike**: A scheduled hike with route, checklist, and invited friends.  
- **Achievements**: User-defined goals (e.g., total distance, number of hikes) with tracked progress.  
- **Activity Feed**: Timeline showing hikes and milestones from friends.

## 🚀 Purpose of this Documentation

This documentation is designed not just to explain the final product but to demonstrate the **process, quality standards, and intentionality** behind its development. It reflects both the *engineering mindset* and *collaborative teamwork* that went into the Hiking Logbook project.
