# Hiking Logbook â€“ Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **Hiking Logbook** project.  
This file serves as a **table of contents** and guide to navigate both **product documentation** (what we built) and **process documentation** (how we built it).  

Our tutor and stakeholder emphasized the importance of **clear, professional, and high-quality documentation**, so this structure is designed to be intentional, consistent, and easy to follow.
